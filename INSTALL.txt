REQUIREMENTS AND NOTES
----------------------

Openfed requires:

- PHP 5.3.5 (or greater) (http://www.php.net/).
- A PHP memory_limit set to 300M (or higher)
- Drush

For further information see Drupal's INSTALL.txt file.


OPTIONAL SERVER REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------

- If you want to use OpenFed's Addemar integration, you will have to enable 
  SOAP on your webserver.


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Download OpenFed from Drupal.org

   You can obtain the latest Openfed release from http://drupal.org -- the files
   are available in .tar.gz and .zip formats and can be extracted using most
   compression tools.

   To download and extract the files, on a typical Unix/Linux command line, use
   the following commands (assuming you want version x.y of Drupal in .tar.gz
   format):

     wget http://drupal.org/files/projects/openfed-x.y.tar.gz
     tar -zxvf openfed-x.y.tar.gz

   This will create a new directory openfed-x.y/ containing all OpenFed files 
   and directories. Then, you will have to build your Drupal installation using
   the drush make command. The usage is as follow :
     
     drush make build-openfed.make /path/to/your/project

2. Follow the standard Drupal way to create your site by creating the database
   and running the install script.
