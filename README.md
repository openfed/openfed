# Openfed D8

OpenFed is a general-purpose, multilingual Drupal 8 distribution.

It is developed by/for the Belgian Federal Public Service for ICT (Fedict) as
part of the Fast2Web offering.


## Installation

The recommended way to install Openfed is using
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).
